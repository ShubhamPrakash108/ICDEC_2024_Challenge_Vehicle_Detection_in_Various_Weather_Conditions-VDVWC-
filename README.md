I am pleased to inform you that I have developed and organized three Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks are as follows:

1. Final Model Notebook: This notebook contains the final version of our model after applying the best hyperparameters.
2. Baseline Model Notebook: This notebook includes the initial baseline model, which serves as a reference point for evaluating the improvements achieved.
3. Hyperparameter Optimization Notebook: This notebook documents the process of finding the optimal hyperparameters for our model.
