I am pleased to inform you that I have developed and organized three Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks are as follows:

1. Final Model Notebook: This notebook contains the final version of our model after applying the best hyperparameters.
2. Baseline Model Notebook: This notebook includes the initial baseline model, which serves as a reference point for evaluating the improvements achieved.
3. Hyperparameter Optimization Notebook: This notebook documents the process of finding the optimal hyperparameters for our model.

Note: The results obtained could potentially be improved with access to more powerful computational resources. Currently, the maximum runtime available on Google Colab with a Tesla T4 GPU is limited to approximately 4 hours. This constraint poses a challenge for extensive hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, it took around 4 hours to complete 10 iterations with 10 epochs each, as detailed in the third notebook. Additionally, using YOLOv10 requires a significant amount of computational resources. Because of this, I chose not to use YOLOv10 for this project.
